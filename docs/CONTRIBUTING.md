# Contribution Guidelines

## Branch Naming

- Your branches should follow the format: `<your_identifier>-branch`. For example, my branch would be `jan-branch`.

## Commit Messages

- Messages should clearly describe the change made.
- E.g. `"Changed X file"` would be too vague. `"Fixed typos in X file"` or `"Added X in Y file"` could work.

## PR Reviews

- Pull requests should be made to the `dev` branch, where they will be reviewed by the Project Manager.
- If the Project Manager has any issues, they will contact you directly.
- Please make sure your github has adequate contact information.
